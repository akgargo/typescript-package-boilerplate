# Folder structure suggestion 2
Including a `.vscode` folder can be very helpful for ensuring a consistent development environment across your team. This folder can contain workspace settings and recommended extensions that will help maintain code quality and consistency. Here's an updated file structure including the `.vscode` folder:

```
your-library/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml          # GitHub Actions configuration for CI
├── .vscode/
│   ├── extensions.json     # Recommended extensions for VSCode
│   └── settings.json       # Workspace settings for VSCode

```

### Folder and File Descriptions

1. **.github/workflows/ci.yml**:
   - Contains the GitHub Actions configuration for continuous integration (CI). This ensures that your tests and linting run automatically on every push and pull request.

2. **.vscode/**:
   - **extensions.json**: Lists recommended extensions for VSCode to ensure all developers use the same tools.
     ```json
     {
       "recommendations": [
         "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
         "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
         "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin"
       ]
     }
     ```
   - **settings.json**: Contains workspace settings for VSCode to enforce consistent formatting and linting.
     ```json
     {
       "editor.formatOnSave": true,
       "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
         "source.fixAll.eslint": true
       },
       "eslint.validate": [
         "typescript",
         "typescriptreact"
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **docs/**:
   - Contains the documentation generated by Typedoc. This folder is typically generated and should not be manually edited. It provides API documentation for your library.

4. **src/**:
   - Contains the source code of your library. This is where you write your TypeScript code.
   - **index.ts**: The entry point of your library. This file typically exports the main functionality of your library.
   - **utils.ts**: An example utility module. You can have multiple modules here, each representing a different part of your library's functionality.

5. **__tests__/**:
   - Contains the test files for your library. Each source file in `src/` should have a corresponding test file in this directory.
   - **index.test.ts**: Tests for the `index.ts` file.
   - **utils.test.ts**: Tests for the `utils.ts` file.

6. **.eslintrc.json**:
   - Configuration file for ESLint, which helps enforce coding standards and catch potential errors.

7. **.prettierrc**:
   - Configuration file for Prettier, which ensures consistent code formatting.

8. **jest.config.js**:
   - Configuration file for Jest, the testing framework.

9. **tsconfig.json**:
   - Configuration file for TypeScript, specifying compiler options and project settings.

10. **package.json**:
    - Configuration file for npm, containing metadata about your project, dependencies, scripts, and more.

11. **README.md**:
    - The main documentation file for your project. It should include an overview, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

12. **CHANGELOG.md**:
    - A file that documents the changes, bug fixes, and new features in each release of your library.

13. **LICENSE**:
    - The license file for your project, specifying the terms under which your library can be used.

14. **.gitignore**:
    - A file specifying which files and directories should be ignored by Git. Common entries include `node_modules`, `dist`, and `coverage`.

### Additional Considerations

- **Examples**: You might want to include an `examples/` directory with example projects or scripts demonstrating how to use your library.
- **Scripts**: If your library includes scripts (e.g., for building, testing, or deploying), you can place them in a `scripts/` directory.
- **Configuration Files**: Any additional configuration files (e.g., for Rollup, Webpack, or other tools) should be placed in the root directory or a dedicated `config/` directory.

By following this structure, you'll ensure that your project is well-organized, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to your library. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
