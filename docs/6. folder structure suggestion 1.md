# Folder structure suggestion 1
Certainly! Here's a recommended file structure for a complex TypeScript npm library, including descriptions of what should go in each folder:

```
your-library/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml          # GitHub Actions configuration for CI
├── docs/                   # Documentation generated by Typedoc
├── src/                    # Source code
│   ├── index.ts            # Entry point for your library
│   ├── utils.ts            # Example utility module
│   └── ...                 # Other source files
├── __tests__/              # Test files
│   ├── index.test.ts       # Tests for index.ts
│   ├── utils.test.ts       # Tests for utils.ts
│   └── ...                 # Other test files
├── .eslintrc.json          # ESLint configuration
├── .prettierrc             # Prettier configuration
├── jest.config.js          # Jest configuration
├── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
├── package.json            # npm configuration
├── README.md               # Project documentation
├── CHANGELOG.md            # Changelog for versioning
├── LICENSE                 # License file
└── .gitignore              # Git ignore file
```

### Folder and File Descriptions

1. **.github/workflows/ci.yml**:
   - Contains the GitHub Actions configuration for continuous integration (CI). This ensures that your tests and linting run automatically on every push and pull request.

2. **docs/**:
   - Contains the documentation generated by Typedoc. This folder is typically generated and should not be manually edited. It provides API documentation for your library.

3. **src/**:
   - Contains the source code of your library. This is where you write your TypeScript code.
   - **index.ts**: The entry point of your library. This file typically exports the main functionality of your library.
   - **utils.ts**: An example utility module. You can have multiple modules here, each representing a different part of your library's functionality.

4. **__tests__/**:
   - Contains the test files for your library. Each source file in `src/` should have a corresponding test file in this directory.
   - **index.test.ts**: Tests for the `index.ts` file.
   - **utils.test.ts**: Tests for the `utils.ts` file.

5. **.eslintrc.json**:
   - Configuration file for ESLint, which helps enforce coding standards and catch potential errors.

6. **.prettierrc**:
   - Configuration file for Prettier, which ensures consistent code formatting.

7. **jest.config.js**:
   - Configuration file for Jest, the testing framework.

8. **tsconfig.json**:
   - Configuration file for TypeScript, specifying compiler options and project settings.

9. **package.json**:
   - Configuration file for npm, containing metadata about your project, dependencies, scripts, and more.

10. **README.md**:
    - The main documentation file for your project. It should include an overview, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

11. **CHANGELOG.md**:
    - A file that documents the changes, bug fixes, and new features in each release of your library.

12. **LICENSE**:
    - The license file for your project, specifying the terms under which your library can be used.

13. **.gitignore**:
    - A file specifying which files and directories should be ignored by Git. Common entries include `node_modules`, `dist`, and `coverage`.

### Additional Considerations

- **Examples**: You might want to include an `examples/` directory with example projects or scripts demonstrating how to use your library.
- **Scripts**: If your library includes scripts (e.g., for building, testing, or deploying), you can place them in a `scripts/` directory.
- **Configuration Files**: Any additional configuration files (e.g., for Rollup, Webpack, or other tools) should be placed in the root directory or a dedicated `config/` directory.

By following this structure, you'll ensure that your project is well-organized, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to your library. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
